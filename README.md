# Ditrit public roadmap

This roadmap repository is for communicating the features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect them to be ready.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- The Ditrit repository concerned by the feature. For a list of the main repositories, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the ```shipped``` label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment.

## Main repositories

Currently, the main repositories we are working on (and present in the roadmap) are:

- **leto**: Frontend application for low-code modelization of application architectures and configurations. 
- **leto-module-client**: Contains generic classes and functions used by **leto**.
- **gandalf**: Backend of **leto**.
- **shoset**: Library for creating multi-ends sockets, used by **gandalf**.
