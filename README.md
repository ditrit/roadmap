# Ditrit public roadmap

This roadmap repository is for communicating the features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect them to be ready.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- The Ditrit repository concerned by the feature. For a list of the main repositories, see below.

- A *release phase* that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- Once a feature is delivered, the *shipped* label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment.

## Main repositories

Currently, the main repositories we are working on (and present in the roadmap) are:

- **leto**: Frontend application providing a converter from architecture files to low-code modelization, along with workspaces and products management. 
- **leto-module-client**: Contains generic classes and functions used by *leto*.
- **gandalf**: Backend for *leto*.
- **shoset**: Network communication tool used by *gandalf*.
- **terrator**: Library for converting Terraform files to JS files (and vice versa). For now it is named *iactor* but should be renamed soon.
- **toscator**: Library for converting Tosca files to JS files (and vice versa).
- **kubernator**: Library for converting Kubernetes files to JS files (and vice versa). Do not exist yet.
- **jenkinator**: Library for converting Jenkins files to JS files (and vice versa). Do not exist yet.
- **githubator**: Library for converting Github files to JS files (and vice versa). Do not exist yet.
